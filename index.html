  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 py-16">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">About Me</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
      I am a Product Manager with hands-on experience owning products end-to-end, from discovery and definition
      to delivery and iteration. I’ve worked on SaaS platforms spanning marketing automation, logistics operations,
      fintech integrations, and enterprise tools.
      <br /><br />
      My approach to product management is grounded in clarity and impact: understanding user and business problems deeply,
      aligning stakeholders around clear priorities, and working closely with engineering and design to deliver solutions
      that are both usable and scalable. I’m particularly comfortable operating in ambiguous environments and
      translating complexity into structured execution.

        M360 Suite – Multi-Module Marketing Platform
      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        <strong>Problem / Context:</strong> Marketing teams managing campaigns across multiple platforms suffered from inefficiency and fragmented tools. M360 Suite provides a unified platform for ads, SEO, community management, email automation, social scheduling, and automated content generation.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        <strong>Role / Scope:</strong> I owned the product end-to-end, from discovery and MVP definition to roadmap planning, stakeholder alignment, and execution with engineering and design teams. I worked closely with users to understand pain points and prioritize features that would maximize adoption and efficiency.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        <strong>Approach / Solution:</strong> Conducted discovery workshops with marketing teams to identify key pain points. Defined MVP features for website building, email automation, ads management, social media scheduling, and community tools. Prioritized features based on impact and feasibility, created user stories and acceptance criteria, and guided iterative development cycles. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure usability, reliability, and timely delivery.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
        <strong>Outcome / Impact:</strong> The platform is live, with early adoption from target users. It significantly reduces campaign management complexity and time, streamlines multi-channel marketing, and provides centralized visibility for marketing teams. Anticipated impact includes a 30–40% improvement in campaign setup efficiency and higher user satisfaction across modules.

        Logistics & Courier Management Platform
      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        <strong>Problem / Context:</strong> Dispatch managers and small businesses lacked a centralized platform to schedule pickups, track deliveries in real-time, and calculate costs efficiently. Manual tracking caused delays, errors, and poor customer visibility.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        <strong>Role / Scope:</strong> I led product definition, user journey mapping, and prioritization of key features. Worked closely with the engineering team to define functional requirements and ensure smooth delivery of both web and mobile applications.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        <strong>Approach / Solution:</strong> Conducted user interviews with dispatch managers and small business owners to understand operational challenges. Designed features for pickup scheduling, real-time tracking, cost estimation, and dashboard visibility. Implemented an iterative release process with continuous feedback loops to refine functionality.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
        <strong>Outcome / Impact:</strong> The platform is about to go live. Early testing shows improved operational efficiency, faster delivery scheduling, and enhanced visibility for dispatch managers. Expected results include a 25–35% reduction in manual errors and significant time savings for operational teams.
