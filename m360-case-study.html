    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      I owned the product end-to-end: discovery, MVP definition, roadmap planning, stakeholder alignment, and execution with engineering and design teams. I conducted workshops with users to identify pain points, prioritized features, and guided iterative development cycles. I also worked closely with the marketing team to validate assumptions and refine the user experience.
