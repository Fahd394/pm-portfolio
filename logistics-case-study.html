    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Problem / Context</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      Dispatch managers and small businesses lacked a centralized platform to schedule pickups, track deliveries in real-time, and calculate costs efficiently. Manual tracking caused delays, errors, and poor customer visibility. The platform was designed to streamline operations and improve accountability.
